Add comprehensive feature parity with go-cid implementation.

This includes 13 major features organized by priority:

**Critical Features (P0):**
- JSON Marshaling (IPLD Format): ``BaseCID.to_json_dict()``, ``BaseCID.from_json_dict()``, and ``CIDJSONEncoder`` for full JSON integration
- Prefix Operations: ``Prefix`` class for CID metadata management, ``Prefix.sum()`` for creating CIDs from data, and ``BaseCID.prefix()`` for extracting prefix

**High Priority Features (P1):**
- /ipfs/ Path Parsing: ``parse_ipfs_path()`` and automatic extraction in ``from_string()``
- Extract Encoding: ``extract_encoding()`` to get multibase encoding without full parsing
- Trailing Bytes Validation: ``from_bytes_strict()`` for strict CID parsing

**Medium Priority Features (P2):**
- Builder Pattern: ``V0Builder`` and ``V1Builder`` for fluent CID construction
- Set Operations: ``CIDSet`` class for managing collections of unique CIDs with full Python set interface
- Defined Check: ``BaseCID.defined()`` to check if CID is valid
- Stream Parsing: ``from_reader()`` for parsing CIDs from streams

**Low Priority Features (P3):**
- MustParse: ``must_parse()`` convenience function for strict parsing
- Binary/Text Marshaling: ``BaseCID.to_bytes()``, ``BaseCID.to_text()``, and ``BaseCID.from_text()``
- KeyString: ``BaseCID.key_string()`` for binary representation as string
- Loggable: ``BaseCID.loggable()`` for logging purposes

All features include comprehensive tests (168 total, 81% coverage) and complete documentation with working code examples.
